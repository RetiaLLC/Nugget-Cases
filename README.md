# Nugget Cases
3D design files + exports for Nugget enclosures & cases!

## How to Print
The models are dimensionally accurate, but filament has a tendency to shrink after cooling!  We recommend printing the `FACEPLATE` and `ENCLOSURE` designs scaled at 101% in the X&Y dimensions.  `DPAD` can be printed at the normal size since button play is acceptable.

## Models
You can find the CAD files for the Nugget "GameBoy" enclosure under the `Developer-Kit` folder.
